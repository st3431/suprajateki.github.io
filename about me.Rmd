Hi there! A little about me, originally from New Jersey, I graduated from Rutgers University- New Brunswick in 2021 with a B.S. in Public Health and a minor in Psychology. I am currently getting my Masters in Public Health (MPH) from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, where I work as a TA for Quantitative Research Methods for first year MPH students. I am in the department of Sociomedical Sciences with a concentration in Chronic Disease Epidemiology. 

Upon graduation, I will be working as a Healthcare Advisory Associate at KPMG.
Learn more about what I'll be doing at [KPMG's Healthcare Advisory Team](https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/07/healthcare-life-sciences-strategy-practice.html)
