A little bit about me, I graduated from Rutgers University- New Brunswick in 2021 with a B.S. in Public Health and a minor in Psychology. I am currently getting my Masters in Public Health (MPH) from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, where I work as a TA for Quantative Research Methods for first year MPH students. I am in the department of Sociomedical Sciences with a concentration in Chronic Disease Epidemiology. 

Upon graduation, I will be working as a Healthcare Advisory Associate at KPMG.
